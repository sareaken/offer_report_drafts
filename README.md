# offer_report_drafts
Draft versions of Offer Report Data Cleaning.

## Draft 1
Comprised of two code blocks, one for each group of code (cleaning vs. categorization).

## Draft 2
Comprised of four code blocks. One file upload block to go with the cleaning data block, and one file upload block to go with the categorization data block.

## Draft 3
Comprised of just one block, combining all code into one code block.

I created 3 separate ones depending on how the file upload process is preferred, i.e. in it's own separate block or combined.
